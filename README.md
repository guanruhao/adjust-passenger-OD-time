# changchun-city-subway
this a simple simulation about changchun's subway system (simplified version).

the picture in above webpage is the line system that i will simulate(except the line above the red color line).
Of course, the map is outdated and the system is much complicated now, so many lines were added, some existing lines have extended their number of stations also the office in charge of public railway transit may updated their trains. but these factors don't influence the research.
